Create new master file with the following fields:
- playerid
- Player
- birth_year
- cbs_name

BUG - Too many Ohtani's!  - Maybe de-dupe at the end?

```{r}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library("lubridate")
library(rvest)

source('./daflFunctions.r')

year <- '2021'

getAge <- function(playerid) {
  print(playerid)
  page <- read_html(str_c("https://www.fangraphs.com/players/nolan-jones/",playerid,"/stats"))
  byear <- page %>% html_node(".player-info__bio-birthdate td") %>% html_text() %>% 
    str_extract("[0-9/]{8,}") %>% mdy() %>% year()
  print(byear)
  byear
}



```
Start by loading table into page
```{r}
bp <- "https://www.fangraphs.com/roster-resource/closer-depth-chart"
page <- read_html(bp)


```

Next, try to pull out the right stuff
```{r}
result <- page %>% html_node(".closer-depth-charts")



```
